# Forget The Milk
Repo to code along the http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/confident-coding-automated-testing-aspdotnet-mvc course by Wes Higbee. It's a great example on how to automate testing in the real world.

The course follows the path many developers go:

1.	write the code and make manual checks
2.	add a way to enter edge cases without the need to start the browser
3.	write an application that verifies the output
4.	use a testing framework (NUnit)
5.	write first the test and then the code (test-first development)
